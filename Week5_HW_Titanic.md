 


## Overview

In this assignment, you'll work into the Titanic dataset to explore the relationship between passengers' ages, their survival status, and gender. You'll employ various data visualization techniques, including histograms, pyramid-style plots, and Kernel Density Estimate (KDE) plots, to uncover insights into how these factors influenced survival rates.

## Objectives

- Analyze age distribution among Titanic passengers.
- Examine survival rates based on age, gender, and passenger class.
- Visualize age distribution among survivors and non-survivors using pyramid-style and KDE plots.

## Instructions

### 1. Load the Dataset

Load the Titanic dataset from Seaborn and familiarize yourself with its structure, especially the 'age', 'sex', 'survived', and 'class' columns.



### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Perform an initial analysis to understand the survival rate:

- Calculate and compare the overall survival rate to the survival rates by gender.
- Explore the age distribution of the dataset.
- Analyze survival rates by passenger class.

### 3. Visualizing Age Distribution by Survival Status

#### 3.1 Histograms for Age Distribution

Create histograms to compare the age distributions of survivors and non-survivors.

#### 3.2 Pyramid-style Age Distribution

Construct a pyramid-style plot to compare age distributions between survivors and non-survivors. This visualization will help highlight which age groups were more likely to survive.

#### 3.3 KDE Plots for Survival by Age ( for male, female and total)

- **KDE Plot for Survival by Age:**
Visualize the age distribution for survivors and non-survivors using KDE plots. This will provide a smooth estimate of the age distributions.

### 4. Bar Graphs for Passenger Class

#### 4.1 Bar Graph of Passenger Class

Create a bar graph to show the distribution of passengers across different classes.

#### 4.2 Bar Graph of Death by Class

Construct a bar graph to visualize the number of deaths by passenger class, either side by side or stacked, to examine the relationship between socio-economic status and survival.

### 5. Conclusion

Based on your visualizations and analysis, discuss the factors that influenced survival rates on the Titanic. Consider the impact of age, gender, and passenger class, and how these factors interacted to determine survival outcomes.

### Submission Guidelines

Submit your Jupyter notebook containing all analyses, visualizations, and conclusions. Ensure your code is well-commented to explain your analysis steps, and your findings are clearly supported by the visualized data.


### Hint: 
To load Titanic Dataset, you can use `seaborn` package.
